                        Hello, and thank you for visiting my site. I love weddings, and photographing them is
                        something I enjoy immensely. Those little romantic moments, the looks, the playfulness
                        and the friendship, are all an important part of your day.{" "}

                        I look forward to talking to you about how to best preserve them. I also welcome
                        inquires about engagement, family portraits, individual portraiture, and destination
                        weddings. For any additional questions, please message me through the "send message"
                        link under the contact information tab. I can't wait to capture your next big day.
